# PacMan
This is a simple PacMan game moving around a specified grid

## Getting Started

There are 2 modes that user can choose from:
* **Gaming mode** - The game will keep listening to a valid user input until a command "EXIT" is received.
* **Normal mode** - The game will read a .txt file(default is "test3.txt" included in "test_case" folder)

The program will ignore invalid commands and print out corresponding message errors and finally print output
